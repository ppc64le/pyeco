PyAV Installation Test
This project has easy tests to check if PyAV and some other packages (ml_dtypes, llvmlite, Pillow) are installed and working.

How to Run
Put the files example.py, subtest.py, and run_av.sh in one folder.

Open a terminal and run:
sh run_pyav.sh

This script will install what you need and run the tests.

What It Tests
PyAV can be used to make videos.
Pillow can create images.
ml_dtypes works with special number types.
llvmlite can run simple code.

All these packages work together.

If you get errors about codecs (like mpeg4), it means your FFmpeg doesnâ€™t support them. The tests will use other codecs.
Make sure FFmpeg is installed and available on your system.
Running these tests helps you check that everything is set up correctly.
