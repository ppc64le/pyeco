## âœ… Program : XGBoost Integrated Environment Test

### Purpose:
Demonstrates interoperability of various libraries by generating synthetic data, training an XGBoost model, analyzing predictions, tokenizing text, signing data cryptographically, sending HTTP requests, and generating Sphinx documentation, all in one pipeline.

### Packages used:
xgboost numpy pandas scipy sentencepiece cryptography

### Functionality:
- Generates a synthetic dataset and trains an XGBoost binary classifier.
- Uses SciPy to analyze predictions and converts some values to Roman numerals.
- Tokenizes textual predictions using SentencePiece.
- Signs prediction data with RSA keys and verifies signatures using Cryptography.
- Sends signed prediction data to a test HTTP endpoint via POST request.
- Creates minimal Sphinx documentation and builds HTML output.
- Cleans up all generated temporary files and directories.

### How to run the example :
```
chmod +x install_test_example.sh
./install_test_example.sh
```
